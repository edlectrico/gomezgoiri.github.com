# Coordination of Internet-connected objects through a Distributed Semantic Space

# Motivation

 1. UbiComp
 1. Space-based computing

???

I'm not talking about the pragmatic motivation, which is to get a PhD ;-)

2 fields influenced me.


---

<!-- Molaría más tener un supertítulo en pequeño para que se notase que sigo en la motivation -->
# Motivation: UbiComp

Environment where devices imperceptibly work on our behalf.

 * Its real power "_comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the interaction of all of them_".

--

 * Lately: IoT and (much less frustating) mobile computing.
  
???

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).


---

# Motivation: space-based computing

 * Decoupling!
 <!-- Dibujito -->
--

 * Often applied to UbiComp
  * Can these devices get more involved in the management of the space?

???

Research question: oportunidad de PhD! :-P

More involved -> Not only mere clients.

---

# Research question

Can these devices get more involved in the management of the space?

 * Problem: devices and applications build upon them are heterogeneous.

???

We face a problem of interoperability.

---

# Interoperability

The IEEE defines it as

 > The ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information
 > and to use the information that has been exchanged. <!-- TODO cite -->

--

 1. To _exchange_ information
 1. To _use_ it
  
  * Syntactic level
  * Semantic level
  
???
 1. Rely on widely accepted communication protocols (interop __ab-initio__)

 1. Syntactic: format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
 1. Semantic: precise meaning of the info
 
  * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->
  * Mencionar SW
   * Space-based + SW = Triple Space Computing!
  * Semantic in limited devices __Overhead__?
    * Many of the current devices are able to manage their info
     * Even if it is more verbosed
     * Some of them can even autonomously reason and expand this information.
    * Other may need to rely in third entities.
    * In any case, we can anticipate a trend.

 And talking about exchanging info...
---

# The Web and Hypermedia APIs

 * Massively accepted way to exchange information for humans...
--
 but also for applications, which expose their capabilities through HTTP APIs.
 
 * REST architectural style comprises the design principles of _the modern web_
 
  * also in the IoT => WoT
  
???

 Principles:
  * Scalability
  * Simplicity
  * Portability
  * etc.

# Hypothesis

_The __alignment of the TSC paradigm with the web's principles__ together with the
consideration of its __energy and computational impact__, leads to UbiComp
environments where heterogeneous devices communicate __autonomously__ in a __decoupled
and interoperable__ fashion._

---

# Objectives

 1. Spaces model for uncoupled communication between participants but enriched with their own managed knowledge.
 1. TSC interface for HTTP compatible with (most of) the REST principles.
 1. Search-aware architecture for end-to-end communication between devices.
 1. Actuation of different actuation mechanisms.
 1. Alignment between space-based communication and direct REST service consumption.
 

???

 Let me sketch some of this points in the remaining minutes.

# New Space model

???

Actually this is simplified version of all my unfruitful attempts.

---

# First attempt

Let all devices provide their own information in a completely decentralized fashion.

Pros:
 
 * Manageability
 * Aligned with the WoT vision
 
  * Interoperability &#10004;

Cons:

 * Devices reliability
 * What about the uncoupling?
 
   * Space uncoupling
--
&#10004;

   * Time uncoupling
--
   x

???

 * You can substitute devices in the space.
 * You don't need to configure the space (devices discover in a space).
 * Podemos lidiar con su confiabilidad: se supone que sus datos no serán críticos.
 * Time uncoupling => needed for coordination purposes
  * Subscription => difficult with unreliable  

---

# Final model

We realized that we used the space for different purposes:

 1. Search information
 1. Coordinate through the space

[IMG ESPACIO]

???

Based on our experience.

Coordination patterns.

---

# Final model: HTTP API

Access to the whole space and to each of the spaces federated devices:

 * Resource oriented: spaces, RDF Graphs, RDF triples
 * HTTP verbs mapped to TSC primitives
 * Status codes, content negotiation, etc.

Almost REST (not hypermedia driven)

???

Spaces: identified by URIs

HATEOAS: future line

* Although it has a human oriented API

 * Reuse REST providers
 * Reuse consumers which use space
 * Avoid their modification
