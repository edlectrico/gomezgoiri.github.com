# Motivation
<!--## (1/6)-->

# Motivation

 1. UbiComp
 1. Space-based computing

???

I'm not talking about the pragmatic motivation, which is to get a PhD ;-)

2 fields influenced me.

---

# Space-based computing
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

 * Space decoupling
 * Time decoupling
 <!-- Dibujito -->

???

 * Ideal for environments which change (in short and long time)
 
---

<!-- Molaría más tener un supertítulo en pequeño para que se notase que sigo en la motivation -->
# UbiComp
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

Devices imperceptibly working on our behalf.

 * Its real power "_comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the __interaction__ of all of them_".
 * IoT and mobile computing.

???

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).

Lately: Internet of Things and (much less frustrating) mobile computing.

## Problem
Devices and applications build upon them are heterogeneous.

---

# Interoperability
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

The IEEE defines it as

 > The ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information
 > and to use the information that has been exchanged. <!-- TODO cite -->
 
---

# Interoperability
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

The IEEE defines it as

 > .weak[The ability of two or more systems or components to __exchange__ information
 > and to __use__ the information that has been exchanged.] <!-- TODO cite -->

???
 1. Rely on widely accepted communication protocols (interop __ab-initio__)

 1. Syntactic level: format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
 1. Semantic level: precise meaning of the info
 
  * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->
  * Mencionar SW

After analyzing these research areas...

Space-based computing:
 * Often applied to UbiComp
 * Used with Semantics

Usually centrallizing so...

I made myself a question (research question, PhD opportunity)

 * Can these devices get more involved in the management of the space?
   ( more involved == Not only mere clients )

  * Semantic in limited devices __Overhead__?
    * Many of the current devices are able to manage their info
     * Even if it is more verbosed
     * Some of them can even autonomously reason and expand this information.
    * Other may need to rely in third entities.
    * In any case, we can anticipate a trend.

Let me sketch some of this points in the remaining minutes.
 
For the sake of time, I omit the 3rd one and explain the rest summarized.

# Space model

???

This is simplified version of all my unfruitful attempts.

5 year process (prior to knowing that I wanted to be a PhD student).

---

# Baseline Model
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

Triple Space Computing (TSC)
 
 * Spaces identified by URIs
 * Tuples == RDF Triples & RDF Graphs
 * Templates = triple patterns

???

Uses elements from the SW

---

# 1st attempt
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

Completely decentralized

 * Each device manages its own information
 * It asks to the rest (P2P)

???

Pros:

 * Avoid depending on others: simplify management
  * each device manages its own knowledge
 * Reduces networking in writings
  * Which are quite frequent (updates of a sensor measure)
 * Unreliable
  * Is there any other way of distributing content?

Cons:

 * Inconsistency (Brewer)
 * Difficult to create: subscription, transactions, etc.
 * JXTA: not really interoperable
 
  * Not appropriate for limited devices
  * Discontinued
  * The hell!
  
---

# 2nd attempt (I)
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

Same model, we substituted the _communication mechanism_
???
To interoperate, it is better to adopt a widely accepted mechanism.

<!-- Mechanism/protocol -->
--
: the Web! 
<!-- poner flechitas hacia el navegador -->
---
 
# The Web and Hypermedia APIs
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

 * Massively accepted <!--by humans.-->
 * A lot of applications expose their capabilities using HTTP APIs
  * Indeed, it has been widely applied to IoT: the _Web of Things_
--

 * REST architectural style comprises the design principles of _the modern web_

<!--  Dibujito o tabla para que se intuya? -->

???

 Properties achieved:
  * Scalability
  * Simplicity
  * Portability
  * etc.

# 2nd attempt (II)
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

TSC interface for HTTP:

 * Resource oriented: spaces, RDF Graphs, RDF triples
 * HTTP verbs mapped to TSC primitives
 * Status codes, content negotiation, etc.

Compatible with (most of) the REST principles.

 * It is not hypermedia driven (yet)

<!--enumerar los principios que cumple-->

???

TSC interface for HTTP compatible with (most of) the REST principles.

HATEOAS: future work.

* Although it has a human oriented API

# Problem with the 1st and 2nd attempts
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

What about the uncoupling?
 
   * Space uncoupling 
???

 * You can substitute devices in the space
 * You don't need to configure the space (devices discover in a space)

--
<span style="color: #4db849;">&#10004;</span>

   * Time uncoupling 
--
<span style="color: #e53f39;">&#10060;</span>

???

 * Needed for coordination purposes
  * But devices are __unreliable__
 * Subscriptions => difficult (i.e. more networking)
 * Replicate contents (i.e. more networking)

---

# Final model
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

We realized that we used the space for different purposes:

 1. Search for information
 1. Coordinate through the space

--

<img alt="Proposed dual model" src="img/new_model.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

<!-- A modo de evaluación o conclusión, poner una tabla con las propiedades -->

???

Based on our experience.

Hence, we propose a dual model.
 * Coordination space
 * Outer space: enhanced by the information provided by autonomous devices
