# Motivation
<!--## (1/6)-->

---

# Motivation

 1. UbiComp
 1. Space-based computing

???

I'm not talking about the pragmatic motivation, which is to get a PhD ;-)

2 fields influenced me.


---

<!-- Molaría más tener un supertítulo en pequeño para que se notase que sigo en la motivation -->
# Motivation: UbiComp

Devices imperceptibly working on our behalf.

 * Its real power "_comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the interaction of all of them_".

--

 * IoT and mobile computing.
 * __Problem__: devices and applications build upon them are heterogeneous.
  
???

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).

Lately: Internet of Things and (much less frustating) mobile computing.

---

# Interoperability

The IEEE defines it as

 > The ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information
 > and to use the information that has been exchanged. <!-- TODO cite -->

--

 1. To _exchange_ information
 1. To _use_ it
  
  * Syntactic level
  * Semantic level
  
???
 1. Rely on widely accepted communication protocols (interop __ab-initio__)

 1. Syntactic: format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
 1. Semantic: precise meaning of the info
 
  * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->
  * Mencionar SW
   * Space-based + SW = Triple Space Computing!
  * Semantic in limited devices __Overhead__?
    * Many of the current devices are able to manage their info
     * Even if it is more verbosed
     * Some of them can even autonomously reason and expand this information.
    * Other may need to rely in third entities.
    * In any case, we can anticipate a trend.
---

# Motivation: space-based computing

 * Decoupling!
 <!-- Dibujito -->
--

 * Often applied to UbiComp
 * Used with Semantics

???

 * Ideal for environments which change (in short and long time)

---

[IMG y análisis]

 * Can these devices get more involved in the management of the space?

???

Research question: oportunidad de PhD! :-P

More involved -> Not only mere clients.

# Thesis outline
<!--## (2/6)-->
<!-- Poner algo para que se sepa que no queda muchísimo -->

---

# Hypothesis

_The __alignment of the TSC paradigm with the web's principles__ together with the
consideration of its __energy and computational impact__, leads to UbiComp
environments where heterogeneous devices communicate __autonomously__ in a __decoupled
and interoperable__ fashion._

---

# Work-areas

 1. Space model.
 1. Search-aware architecture for end-to-end communication between devices.
 1. Actuation of different actuation mechanisms.

???

 Let me sketch some of this points in the remaining minutes.

# New Space model

???

This is simplified version of all my unfruitful attempts.

5 year process (prior to knowing that I wanted to be a PhD student).

---

# Baseline Model 

Triple Space Computing (TSC)
 
 * Spaces identified by URIs
 * Tuples == RDF Triples & RDF Graphs
 * Templates = triple patterns

???

Uses elements from the SW

--

# Model: 1st attempt

Completely decentralized

 * Each device manages its own information
 * Ask to the rest (P2P)

???

Pros:

 * Avoid depending on others: simplify management
  * each device manages its own knowledge
 * Reduces networking in writings
  * Which are quite frequent (updates of a sensor measure)
 * Unreliable
  * Is there any other way of distributing content?

Cons:

 * Inconsistency (Brewer)
 * Difficult to create: subscription, transactions, etc.
 * JXTA: not really interoperable
 
  * Not appropriate for limited devices
  * Discontinued
  * The hell!
  
---

# Model: 2nd attempt (I)

Same model, substitute the communication mechanism.

 * To interoperate, it is better to adopt a widely accepted mechanism
--
: the Web!

???

 Mechanism/protocol

---
 
# The Web and Hypermedia APIs

 * Massively accepted by humans.
 * Also for applications, which expose their capabilities through HTTP APIs.
-- 
 * REST architectural style comprises the design principles of _the modern web_
 
  * indeed, it has an efect in the IoT: Web of Things
  
???

 Properties achieved:
  * Scalability
  * Simplicity
  * Portability
  * etc.
 
 1. TSC interface for HTTP compatible with (most of) the REST principles.
 
---

# Model: 2nd attempt (II)

TSC interface for HTTP compatible with (most of) the REST principles.

 * Resource oriented: spaces, RDF Graphs, RDF triples
 * HTTP verbs mapped to TSC primitives
 * Status codes, content negotiation, etc.

It is not hypermedia driven (yet).

Still...

???

HATEOAS: future work.

* Although it has a human oriented API
--

# Problem with the 1st and 2nd attempts

What about the uncoupling?
 
   * Space uncoupling
???

 * You can substitute devices in the space.
 * You don't need to configure the space (devices discover in a space).

--
&#10004;

   * Time uncoupling
--
   x

???

 * Needed for coordination purposes
  * But devices are __unreliable__
 * Subscriptions => difficult (i.e. more networking)
 * Replicate contents (i.e. more networking)

---

# Final model

We realized that we used the space for different purposes:

 1. Search information
 1. Coordinate through the space
