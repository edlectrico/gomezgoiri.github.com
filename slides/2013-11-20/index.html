# Coordination of Internet-connected objects through a Distributed Semantic Space

# Motivation

 1. UbiComp
 1. Space-based computing

???

I'm not talking about the pragmatic motivation, which is to get a PhD ;-)

2 fields influenced me.

<!-- Molaría más tener un supertítulo en pequeño para que se notase que sigo en la motivation -->
# Motivation: UbiComp

Environment where devices imperceptibly work on our behalf.

 * Its real power "_comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the interaction of all of them_".

--

 * Lately: IoT and (much less frustating) mobile computing.
  
???

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).


---

# Motivation: space-based computing

 * Decoupling!
 <!-- Dibujito -->
--

 * Often applied to UbiComp
  * Can these devices get more involved in the management of the space?

???

Research question: oportunidad de PhD! :-P

More involved -> Not only mere clients.

---

# Research question

Can these devices get more involved in the management of the space?

 * Problem: devices and applications build upon them are heterogeneous.

???

We face a problem of interoperability.

---

# Interoperability

The IEEE defines it as

 > The ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information
 > and to use the information that has been exchanged. <!-- TODO cite -->

--

 1. To _exchange_ information
 1. To _use_ it
  
  * Syntactic level
  * Semantic level

???

 1. Rely on widely accepted communication protocols (interop __ab-initio__)
 
 1. Syntactic: format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
 1. Semantic: precise meaning of the info
 
  * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->
  * Mencionar SW
   * Space-based + SW = Triple Space Computing

 And talking about exchanging info...
 
---

# The Web and Hypermedia APIs

 * Massively accepted way to exchange information for humans...
--
 but also for applications, which expose their capabilities through HTTP APIs.
 
 * REST architectural style comprises the design principles of _the modern web_

---

# Hypothesis

_The __alignment of the TSC paradigm with the web's principles__ together with the
consideration of its __energy and computational impact__, leads to UbiComp
environments where heterogeneous devices communicate __autonomously__ in a __decoupled
and interoperable__ fashion._
