# Motivation

<img alt="And god said: let's make Internet" src="img/transpas/internet01.png" style="width: 90%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

???

In the beginning researchers created the Internet.
(todo el guiño a la biblia)

Internet composed by few computers.

---

# Motivation

<img alt="Internet popularizes" src="img/transpas/internet02.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

Then, the popularity of the Internet grew and connecting computers became easier and cheaper.

More and more.

---

# Motivation

<img alt="Wireless comes to the Internet" src="img/transpas/internet03.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

Thanks to wireless technologies, devices can connect to the Internet without having to be physically connected to a network.

---

# Motivation

<img alt="Mobile computing appears" src="img/transpas/internet04.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

So the __mobile computing__ appeared.

---

# Motivation

<img alt="The Internet of Things appears" src="img/transpas/internet05.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

Nowadays, __not only__ a wider range of smartphones, but also everyday objects like cars or washing machines connect to the Internet to exchange information.

This is what __is know as__ the Internet of Things (IoT).

---

# Motivation: UbiComp

<img alt="Guy reading the news while his home works on his behalf" src="img/transpas/ubicomp01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

And particularly the IoT and the mobile computing have __contributed to Ubicomp__.

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).

It describes environments where devices imperceptibly work on our behalf.

---

# Motivation: UbiComp

<img alt="Devices work together" src="img/transpas/ubicomp02.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

But, in Mark's words, UbiComp's real power "comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the __interaction of all__ of them".

This interaction brings __challenges__ to UbiComp.

In this thesis I've  focused on two of them.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 1: dynamism

<img alt="Guy reading the news while his home works on his behalf" src="img/transpas/ubicomp01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

First, we have the dynamism.

This dinamicity has its effects both in the short and the long term.

In the short term, due to devices' mobile nature, they can come and go frequently.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 1: dynamism

<img alt="The umbrella goes out" src="img/transpas/ubicomp03.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

For instance, in the figure we can see that the umbrella which was in the stand few moments ago, is now being used outside the house.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 1: dynamism

<img alt="Guy reading the news while his home works on his behalf" src="img/transpas/ubicomp01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

The environment also changes in the long term whenever we definitely replace an element.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 1: dynamism

<img alt="The clock is renewed" src="img/transpas/ubicomp04.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

For instance, we could replace the our smart clock with a new version.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 1: proposed solution

<img alt="Space based computing: rd, in and out primitives" src="img/transpas/space-based.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

???

To face this dynamism, we propose the use of space-based computing (or Tuple Spaces).

Tuple Spaces is a paradigm where nodes coordinate with each other by writing and reading structured pieces of information (i.e., tuples) in a shared space.

This paradigm can be uncoupled in space and time.

__Space uncoupling__ is achieved because the nodes don't need to know each other beforehand to communicate.
That is, TS' primitives do not care about addresses and references, they just care about the content being shared.

__Time uncoupling__ is achieved because two nodes communicating with each other do not need to coexist at the same time.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity

<img alt="Dude, what are you talking about?" src="img/transpas/interoperability01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">
<!-- dispositivos hablando chino, coreano, cirilico y alphabeto -->

???

The second challenge UbiComp has to face is that both the devices and the applications build upon them are heterogeneous.

That is, the interoperability is a key property for these environments.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity

The IEEE defines __interoperability__ as

 > The ability of two or more systems or components to __exchange__ information
 > and to __use__ the information that has been exchanged. <!-- TODO cite -->

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity

The IEEE defines __interoperability__ as

> .weak[The ability of two or more systems or components to _exchange_ information
> and to __use__ the information that has been exchanged.]

???

So, let's first talk about the second problem: how to use (or reuse) information.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2b: use info

<img alt="The robot does not understand chinese or japanese" src="img/transpas/interoperability02.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

We can identify two levels two allow this __use__:

 1. The  __syntactic__ level cares about  the format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
    * For instance, if the robot does not undestand chinese characters, the information the mobile phone provides will be useless.

 1. The __semantic__ level gives a precise meaning to the info
    * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->
    * Following the example, this character may mean different things depending on the context.
    * Funnily enough, I translated something to chinese for this presentation using an automatic tool.
    * When my co-supervisor asked about the meaning to a chinese colleague, it was confused because the meaning was either "X or X".

---


# UbiComp, challenge 2b: proposed solution

<img alt="The robot does understand terms" src="img/transpas/interoperability03.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

To achieve both levels, I propose to use __Semantic Web__ standards and tools.

 > .weak[The __vision__ of the Semantic Web is to extend principles of the Web from documents to data.
 > Data should be accessed using the general Web architecture using, e.g., URI-s;
 > data should be __related to one another__ just as documents (or portions of documents) are already.
 > This also means creation of a common framework that allows data
 > to be __shared and reused__ across application, enterprise, and community boundaries,
 > to be __processed automatically__ by tools as well as manually,
 > including revealing possible __new relationships__ among pieces of data.]

<!-- Aprovecho esta ptranspa para hacer una pasada superficial al estado del arte -->

After analyzing these research areas in the UbiComp domain I saw that...

Space-based computing

 * has often been applied to UbiComp
 * and it has also been used with Semantics,
 * but usually centrallizing the space on powerful devices.

This makes perfect sense since

 1. semantic processing can add too much overhead to limited devices
 2. it is hard to ensure the space's availability with unsteady (too dynamic) devices

However,

 1. current embedded and mobile devices are notably more powerful than 5 years ago
 <!--
 TODO
 Preparar una transpa de backup por si preguntan cómo de viable es.
 Ideas:
   * Many of the current devices are able to manage their info
   * Gráfico con pruebas que hicimos en su día:
    * Even if it is more verbosed
    * Some of them can reason and expand this information.
    * Others may need to rely in third machines.
     * Out of the scope
    * Anyway, we might be anticipating a trend.
 -->
 2. having dedicated servers is costly and hard to manage in simple scenarios


So, with these considerations in mind, I made myself a question:
<!-- research question => PhD opportunity -->

 * Can these devices get __more involved__ in the management of the space?
   Not only as mere clients.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2a:  exchange info

The IEEE defines _interoperability_ as

 > .weak[The ability of two or more systems or components to __exchange__ information
 > and to _use_ the information that has been exchanged.] <!-- TODO cite -->


???

But, to talk about this involvement of the apparently limited devices, let me first resume to the sub-challenge we did not tackled before: __how to exchange information__.

To interoperate, it is better to adopt a __widely accepted__ communication mechanism. <!-- mechanism/protocols -->
This is called interop __ab-initio__.

And what's more accepted today than...

---

.center[
<h2 style="margin-top:5em;">the Web!</h2>]

???

...the web?

Even this presentation is part of the web!

http://rawgit.com/gomezgoiri/gomezgoiri.github.com/master/slides/thesis/index.html

---

# Why the Web?
.subtitle[
## UbiComp, challenge 2a:  exchange info
]

 * Massively accepted <!--by humans. (this is not a real reason) -->
  * By humans
  * Also, a lot of applications expose their capabilities using HTTP APIs
--

 * Scalability
 * Simplicity
 * Portability
 * etc.

???

__REST__ architectural style comprises the design principles of _the modern web_

It achieves the following properties  (see Fielding's thesis)

Note that most of these properties are particularly useful for limited devices.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2a:  exchange info

<img alt="The web of Things" src="img/transpas/wot.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

As a consequence, the web has been widely applied to IoT, bringing what people has called the __Web of Things__ (WoT).

<!-- Transpa backup: WoT challenges: push approach, subscription mechanisms... -->

In the WoT, everyday things expose their capabilities through web standards so they are first-class web citizens.
This way, they can seamlessly work with other web apps.

This goes along with my interest in having devices which are not mere clients, but also active data providers.

# Goals

 1. Space model
 2. Search architecture
 3. Actuation mechanism

---

# Space model

<img alt="Proposed dual model" src="img/new_model.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

Analysis:

 * Networking properties
 * Coordination properties
 * Is it for limited devices?

???

After several attempts... this model confines much of the information in the devices
(explicar que detras de esto hay una motivación personal).

We proposed a __dual model__.

* Coordination space
 * Enhanced by the information provided by autonomous devices
* Outer space:
 * __Enriched view__
 * what's happening on __real time__

---

# Space model: networking properties

HTTP API for TSC:

 * __Resource oriented__: spaces, RDF Graphs, RDF triples

 * HTTP __verbs__ mapped to TSC __primitives__

 * Other features: status codes, content negotiation, etc.

 * It is not hypermedia driven (yet)

  [tabla de propiedades networking]

<!--enumerar los principios que cumple-->

???

TSC interface for HTTP compatible with (most of) the REST principles.

HATEOAS: future work.

* Although it has a human oriented API

Drawbacks not mentioned yet:

 * subscription, transactions, etc. vs stateless

# Space model: coordination properties

What about the uncoupling?

<div style="margin-top: 1em;">
 <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Space uncoupling</span>
 <span style="float:right;">Time uncoupling</span>

    <span style="margin-left: 40%; color: #e53f39; font-size: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle;">&#10060;</span>
</span>
</div>

???

* Programmers only care about data (__forced__ by the primitives)
* Provider holds its content...
  * only accessible when the provider is available
* __Move contents__ to other nodes
  * how to distinguish the reliable ones?
  * measures away from where they are generated
   * what if the other node lefts the space but the provider is available?
* Replicate contents
  * more networking
  * not easy (unreliable => networking)
* __Complex__

We realized that we used the space for different purposes:

 1. Search for information
 1. Coordinate through the space

__Time__ uncoupling particularly __important for coordination__

* No so much for search (real time)

Problems:

 *  When devices rely on others to provide information, it is not guaranteed
 that the information accessed will accurately represent the last information
 available in the data providers (e.g., the sensors).

 * Once they rely on intermediaries, these intermediaries must be available at
 all time. Otherwise, the devices would not be able to talk to each other.

  * ¡Poner ejemplo de Navastag!

# My solution: Let's promote the direct communication

I did this prior to knowing that I wanted to be a PhD student.

Alternative model.

Benefits:

* Reduces __dependency__ on others
  * each device manages its own knowledge
  * this simplifies the __management__
* Reduces networking in __writings__
  * Which are quite frequent (updates of a sensor measure)

Drawbacks:

* Flooding-based __search__: networking
* __Inconsistency__ (Brewer)
* __JXTA__: not really interoperable

  * Not appropriate for limited devices
  * Discontinued
  * A nightmare!
