In the beginning researchers created the Internet.

Internet composed by few computers.

Consequently, more and more computers got connected.

So the __mobile computing__ appeared.

<img alt="The Internet of Things appears" src="img/transpas/internet05.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

Nowadays, __not only__ a wider range of smartphones, but also everyday objects like cars or washing machines connect to the Internet to exchange information.

This is what __is know as__ the Internet of Things (IoT).

<img alt="Guy reading the news while his home works on his behalf" src="img/transpas/ubicomp01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

Both the IoT and the mobile computing have __contributed to Ubicomp__.

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).

It describes environments where devices imperceptibly work on our behalf.

---

<img alt="Devices work together" src="img/transpas/ubicomp02.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

But, in Mark's words, UbiComp's real power "comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the __interaction of all__ of them".

This interaction brings __challenges__ to UbiComp.

In this thesis I've  focused on two of them.

# UbiComp, challenge 1: dynamism
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="Guy reading the news while his home works on his behalf" src="img/transpas/ubicomp01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

First, we have the dynamism.

This dynamism has its effects both in the short and the long term.

Since most devices have a mobile nature, they can come and go frequently in the short term.

# UbiComp, challenge 1: proposed solution

<img alt="Space based computing: rd, in and out primitives" src="img/transpas/space-based.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

???

Space-based computing (or Tuple Spaces) faces this dynamism successfully.

Tuple Spaces is a paradigm where nodes coordinate with each other by writing and reading structured pieces of information (i.e., tuples) in a shared space.

This paradigm can be uncoupled in space and time.

__Space uncoupling__ is achieved because the nodes don't need to know each other beforehand to communicate.
That is, TS' primitives do not care about addresses and references, they just care about the content being shared.

__Time uncoupling__ is achieved because two nodes communicating with each other do not need to coexist at the same time.

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="Dude, what are you talking about?" src="img/transpas/interoperability01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

The second challenge UbiComp has to face is that both the devices and the applications build upon them are heterogeneous.

This means that the interoperability is a key property for these environments.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

The [IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2238) defines __interoperability__ as

 > The ability of two or more systems or components to __exchange__ information
 > and to __use__ the information that has been exchanged.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

The [IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2238) defines __interoperability__ as

> .weak[The ability of two or more systems or components to _exchange_ information
> and to __use__ the information that has been exchanged.]

???

So, let's first talk about the second problem: how to use (or reuse) information.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2a: use info
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="The robot does not understand chinese or japanese" src="img/transpas/interoperability02.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

We can identify two levels to allow this __use__:

 1. The  __syntactic__ level cares about  the format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
    * For instance, if the robot does not undestand chinese characters, the information the mobile phone provides will be useless.

 1. The __semantic__ level gives a precise meaning to the info
    * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->
    * Following the example, this character may mean different things depending on the context (and it does actually).
    * TODO Preguntar a primez cual era el caracter conflictivo!
     * Funnily enough, I translated something to chinese for this presentation using an automatic tool.
     * When my co-supervisor asked about the meaning to a chinese colleague, it was confused because the meaning was either "X or X".

# UbiComp, challenge 2a: proposed solution
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="The robot does understand terms" src="img/transpas/interoperability03.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

To achieve both levels, I propose to use __Semantic Web__ standards and tools.

 > .weak[The __vision__ of the Semantic Web is to extend principles of the Web from documents to data.
 > Data should be accessed using the general Web architecture using, e.g., URI-s;
 > data should be __related to one another__ just as documents (or portions of documents) are already.
 > This also means creation of a common framework that allows data
 > to be __shared and reused__ across application, enterprise, and community boundaries,
 > to be __processed automatically__ by tools as well as manually,
 > including revealing possible __new relationships__ among pieces of data.]

# UbiComp, challenge 2b:  exchange info

The [IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2238)  defines _interoperability_ as

 > .weak[The ability of two or more systems or components to __exchange__ information
 > and to _use_ the information that has been exchanged.]


???

The other aspect which affect the interoperability is __how to exchange information__.

To interoperate, it is better to adopt a __widely accepted__ communication mechanism. <!-- mechanism/protocols -->
This is called interop __ab-initio__.

And what's more accepted today than...

<img alt="The web is widely accepted" src="img/transpas/web_accepted01.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

The web is massively accepted <!--by humans. (this is not a real reason) -->
 * By humans
 * But also, by machines: a lot of applications expose their capabilities using HTTP APIs

__REST__ architectural style comprises the design principles of _the modern web_

It achieves the following properties  (see Fielding's thesis)

* Scalability
* Simplicity
* Portability
* etc.

Note that most of these properties are particularly useful for limited devices.

<img alt="The web of Things" src="img/transpas/wot.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

As a consequence, the web has been widely applied to IoT, bringing what people has called the __Web of Things__ (WoT).

<!-- Transpa backup: WoT challenges: push approach, subscription mechanisms... -->

In the WoT, everyday things expose their capabilities through web standards.
This way, they are first-class web citizens and can seamlessly work with other web apps.

This goes hand in hand with my interest in having devices which are not mere clients, but also active data providers.

<!-- TODO Delimit the scope in this section or in the next one? -->

<img alt="Scope of the dissertation" src="img/transpas/venn_background.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

<!-- Aprovecho esta ptranspa para hacer una pasada superficial al estado del arte -->

After analyzing these research areas in the UbiComp domain I saw that...

Space-based computing

 * has often been applied to UbiComp
 * and it has also been used with Semantics (I focus on Triple Space Computing paradigm or TSC), <!-- Necesario porque luego lo nombro en la hipotesis -->
 * but usually centrallizing the space on powerful devices.

This is also common in most of the systems which use the Semantic Web in UbiComp.

# Common design: delegate semantic provision
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision01.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

So, one popular design solution when working with limited devices is to centralize all the knowledge in a more powerful machine (or machines).
For sake of clarity, let's assume that there is just one machine.

This way, the devices periodically send their information to this machine,
and it stores all the information.

---

# Common design: delegate semantic provision
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision02.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

Whenever a limited device needs to query for something, it has to ask to this machine.

---

# Common design: delegate semantic provision
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision03.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

The reasons to do this are mainly two:

 1. semantic processing can add too much overhead to limited devices
 2. it is hard to ensure the information availability with unsteady (too dynamic) devices

However,

 1. Availability is not always a requirement. In fact, the unavailability, "represents" the mobile nature of the environment/space.
 1. Current embedded and mobile devices are notably more powerful than 5 years ago

And, now, let me do a brief parenthesis to talk about this...

---

# "Small" or "limited" are relative adjectives <!-- IoT? Energy-aware? -->
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/dunk-portrait-2006.jpg" class="center" style="width: 20em;"/>
<!-- Explain: which devices, results for semantic web testings, the evolution experienced since I first started working in this -->

???

The player in the center is Nate Robinson who, compared to any of the remaining NBA players will be considered small.
However, I'm about 4cm smaller than him, so I wouldn't particularly consider him small.

My dissertation has been focused on the limited devices needs and, still, what I propose might not be appropriate for several current limited platforms.

So, what does "limited" mean for me?
In short: any device able to manage semantic annotations.
Anyhow, I propose several adaptations in my model for more restricted ones.
Really limited ones should use a Gateway, and this gateway would be part of my solution.

Personally, I have tested the feasibility of using the semantic web in limited platforms.
Later on, I will present some of this results.

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision04.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

So, after this parenthesis, let's return to the delegation of semantic provision and management from limited to more powerful devices.

This design has two problems.

First, when devices rely on others to provide information, it is not guaranteed
that the information accessed will accurately represent the last information
available in the data providers.

In the example, we see a limited device (e.g, a sensor) with a version of its contents created at _t3_.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision05.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

It sends its contents to a server.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision06.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

This server stores this version.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision07.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

Afterwards, the sensor generates a new version with new measures at t6.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision08.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

It is obvious that if other device now asked for the content provided by this sensor to the server...

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision09.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

...it will get the outdated version.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 2
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision10.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

The second problem happens because once devices rely on intermediaries,
these intermediaries must be available at all time.
Otherwise, the devices would not be able to talk to each other.

Note that,

 * Having dedicated servers is costly and hard to manage in simple scenarios
 * Externalizing these servers, makes you system dependant on third-parties.

And this happens way too frequently on the Internet.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 2
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/navaztag.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

For example, the Navastag was an IoT which completely depent on an external service.
The company of this internet-connected bunny dissapeared and they did not maintain the servers.
<!-- They released a poorly documented code. -->
As a consequence, nowadays the Navastag is pretty much an expensive decoration.


So, with these considerations in mind, I made myself a question:
<!-- research question => PhD opportunity -->

 * Can these devices get __more involved__ in the management of the space?
   Not only as mere clients.

# Goals

 1. Space model

 3. Actuation mechanism

[ ICONS? ]

???

1. Propose a new space model which merges the benefits from Space-based computing and the web.
1. An energy-aware search for this new model.
1. An actuation mechanism.

In my dissertation, and in this presentation, I've focused on the second aspect.

Consequently, I will restrict myself to a brief comment on the first and third points.

# Space model

<img alt="Proposed dual model" src="img/new_model.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

Analysis:

 * Networking properties
 * Coordination properties
 * Is it for limited devices?

???

After several attempts, I came up with the __dual model__ shown in the figure.

It is composed by:

 * Coordination space
  * Pretty much a classical semantic space
  * It is enhanced by the information provided by autonomous devices (or asteroids) which are part of the
 * Outer space
  * __Enriched view__
  * what's happening on __real time__

This model confines much of the information in the devices.

I analysed this model from different perspectives.

To analyse the networking properties of the solution proposed, we must note that both spaces are accessed through their APIs.

---

Both APIs are based on the space-based computing primitives, which are compatible with (most of) the REST principles:

<img alt="The API is not hypermedia-driven" src="img/transpas/networking_properties05.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

Unfortunately, the APIs are not hypermedia-driven, that is they do not follow the HATEOAS REST principle.

In short, this principle means that the client should not __know__ anything apart from an __URL__ to use an API.
It should drive the interaction __selecting the new application states__ from the web hypermedia content provided by the server at each step.

Although, the API is actually hypermedia-driven for humans, it is not for machines.
This has left as future work.

---

# Networking properties

REST-like APIs

* Scalability
* Simplicity
* UP performance
* Efficiency
* Evolvability

???

Anyway, accessing to the spaces through a REST-like API provides the following features to our model:

* Scalability (4+)
* Simplicity (3+-)
* UP performance, efficiency & evolvability (2+)
* and others [avoid enumeration]
 * Portability, extensibility, configurability, reusability & reliability (+)
 * Visibility (+-)
 * Net performance (-)

And it also comes with some drawbacks:

* Less simplicity, reusability & visibility than pure REST APIs (hypermedia-driven)
* Mechanisms such as subscriptions and transactions go against the statelessness

 <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Space uncoupling</span>
 <span style="float:right;">Time uncoupling</span>

???

But, having a part of the model which is based on the web also affects uncoupling.

[Move the explanation of uncoupling here?]

  </span>

???

Obviously, the coordination space corresponds with the clasical model and therefore has both uncoupling levels.

???

In the _outer space_, programmers are forced by space-based primitives not to care about data too.

--
      <span style="margin-left: 40%; color: #e53f39; font-size: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle;">&#10060;</span>
  </span>
</div>

???

However, regarding _time uncoupling_, since each provider holds its content, this is only accessible when the provider is available.

Some possible solutions to avoid this uncoupling would be: to move contents to other nodes or to replicate contents.
However, this will come at the cost of more complexity and networking activity.
<!-- * __Move contents__ to other nodes
  * how to distinguish the reliable ones?
  * the measures would be moved away from where they are generated
   * what if the other node lefts the space but the provider is available?
* __Replicate__ contents
  * more networking
  * maintaining the data consistency is not easy with unreliable nodes
-->

Therefore, I kept it this way, with an time coupled outer-space, when I identified (realized) that we used the space for different purposes:

 1. Search for information
 1. Coordinate through the space

Time uncoupling is particularly important for coordination, but not so much to search (in real time).

Finally, we can see how the properties commented before interrelate with desirable properties in UbiComp.

Particularly, we can see two conflictive interrelations:

Firstly, the web has a low networking perfomance.

To reduce or mitigate it, we can redesign the API or just adopt more lightweight protocols (e.g., CoAP which mimics many of HTTP's properties).

Secondly, the semantic web negatively affects computation overload and energy autonomy.

For this purpose, we have specifically designed a search architecture.

Devices need to communicate with each other directly, but this cannot be done at any price.

For instance, a broadcasting-based solution will generate a high computation and networking activity.

To find out how this computing and networking activities could affect an embedded platform,
I checked their effects in a FoxG20 embedded device.

# Energy consumption: an example
.subtitle[

<img alt="Energy consumption for each type of activity" src="img/energy_consumption.svg" style="width: 80%;" class="center" />

???

In periods when it reasons or attends HTTP requests, it consumes approximately 20% more energy.
In other platforms, similar energy wastes can be presumed.

But beyond concrete energy consumptions, what this __chart transmits__ is that since computation and networking result in significant higher energy consumption,
we need to find a strategy which efficiently manages both aspects.

# Roles
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

<img alt="Energy-aware search architecture" src="img/transpas/architecture.svg" style="width: 100%;" class="center" />

???

What I conceived is an architecture which uses "search facilitators" to help nodes to __improve__ their search process.

This "search facilitator", called White Page from now on, is chosen dynamically between all the nodes in a space and can change over the time.
 
Apart from the White Page role, a node can have the __Provider__ or the __Consumer__ role.

* _Providers_, the green pentagons in the Figure, carry their own information
 * In the figure this knowledge is represented by the purple circles
 * _Providers_ summarize this knowledge into pieces of information called _clues_
 * In the figure, the blue triangles
 * This triangles are sent to the WP.
* _Consumers_, the red squares, directly request/query providers to obtain fresh data
 * From time to time, they obtain all the individual _clues_ from the WP in what is called an _aggregated clue_
 * Using this _aggregated clue_ data, their are able to independently resolve their queries

---

# Clues
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/clues_working.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

<!-- schema prov sending a clue and getting an aggregated clue version -->

???

Note that the system is based in an assumption:
_clues do not change frequently since they represent the type of information the nodes host rather than the specific data which is constantly generated_

* A clue is generated by a provider and sent to the WP getting an aggregated clue version in any of the following situations:
 1. when a clue is updated
 2. before its lifetime expires
 3. whenever there is a new WP in the Space with a lower setup version than the one in the Provider

* Consumers obtain an _aggregated clue_ when
  1. they don't have one
  2. periodically
   * upper time: ensures a fresh view
   * lower time: not to flood the WP
   * in between, with the last 10 queries
 * they process them to decide which nodes to ask for information
 * as an optimization WP can answer directly the nodes to ask for

---

# Clue content
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="Semantic example and clue types" src="img/transpas/semantic_example.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

???

The semantic web is formed by RDF triples.
They are composed by a subject, a predicate and an object.
As a query language, I have considered wildcard-patterns such as the ones shown at the bottom of the image.
<!-- TODO transpa backup explicando por qué no SPARQL -->

Clues need to:

* summarize the information hold by a provider
* not change frequently

To this end, I considered three alternatives:

* __Predicates__ which contain the relations between terms (just the significants).
 * In the example, ssn:observes and ssn:observedBy.
* __Classes__ stored which detail which types of terms a node provides.
 * In the example, ssn:Sensor and weather:RainfallObservation.
* __Prefixes__, which indicate the vocabularies used by the node to describe the knowledge provided.
 * In the example, ssn, weather, sweet and ex.

# Discovery
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

[schema]

???

To run our proposal, we require a discovery system able to

1. get the Spaces that a particular node belongs to,
2. identify the WP in the system and its setup version, and
3. provide additional information about nodes to decide which one can be the next WP.

I tested the impact of the discovery mechanism using mDNS and DNS-SD.
However, the specific mechanism used is transversal to the architecture.

---

# White page selection
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/selection_algorithm.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

The selection process can start

1. when no WP is available (the first node to realize the absence starts it) or
2. when the current WP gets a worse score than other nodes (the current WP)


How? Ranking them according to information provided by the discovery mechanism.

* memory of the device
* storage capacity of the device
* approximate time since it joined the Space (to estimate its reliability)
* its battery level

The goal of this ranking is to move the additional load needed to maintain the architecture to the most __powerful and stable__ device in the space.

# Experimental environment: simulation inputs

<img alt="Real time measures" src="img/transpas/time_measures.png" style="width: 100%;" />
[I will replace this table, with a chart, the photos of the real devices used and their specs]

???

To test all this architecture, I carried out several simulations.

To parametrize them, I used the following response times as inputs.
They have been measured in the real platforms shown and they affect the performance of the solution and indirectly how much energy is consumed.

# Experimental environment: simulation inputs

<img alt="Sample templates" src="img/transpas/evaluation_templates.png" style="width: 100%;" />
[Apart from this, I will enumerate the sources of my datasets to show they authenticity]

???

For the data provided in the simulation, I used real knowledge from real datasets describing sensing stations and their measures.

The templates used are the ones shown.
They consider queries from different nature.

[Schema showing how negative broadcasting works]

<!-- FIXME Añadir una transpa justificativa de por qué no he implementado otras del estado del arte!
Poner las que luego ví que existían basadas en cachear, por lo cual medio cubro esto :-P
Otras o muy complejas de implementar, o no ponían el código.
-->

???

As a baseline for the comparison, I used the rawest strategy: negative broadcasting.
In this strategy, a node propagates its query to the rest of the nodes it knows about.

As an optimization, a node can memorize which nodes successfully answer the same query in the past.
That is, a caching strategy.

# Evaluation: Network activity

<img alt="Requests generated using different strategies" src="img/requests_by_strategies.svg" style="width: 90%;" />

???

Obviously it is better than NB.

And comparing to caching, it depends on the # of consumer and the # of queries.

For the same number of queries, the more consumers there are, the closer to NB caching behaves.
The figure shows that with 100 consumer, the caching strategy is in between NB and our solution.

With just one consumer it is better than our solution in most of the cases.
It gets closer to our solution as the network size increases.
For the same number of queries, the more of each elements the scenario has, the better our solution is compared to caching.

<!-- NOTA este caso es uno en el que las clues permiten discriminar muy bien, caching es mejor para preguntas que se repiten mucho,

# Evaluation: Network activity (by device type)

<img alt="Energy consumption for each class" src="img/activity_measures.svg" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10%;" />

???

On the left hand side we can see how on average, each device __reduces its activity__ considerably.

On the right hand side, we see two desired effects:

 * the limited devices face less requests and consequently reduce their activity
 * the additional tasks generated by the solution are moved to the more powerful ones

---

# Evaluation: Network activity (high dynamism)

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/evaluation_dynamic.png" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10%;" />

???

This evaluation shows what happens when we have a very dynamic scenario where nodes frequently come and go.
Specifically, it simulates nodes joining and leaving the Space at different intervals: 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 45 minutes.
We also added an scenario with no drops as a baseline.
Note that we represent this scenario by configuring the drop-interval with a greater value than the simulation time.


Furthermore, the evaluation tests the most harmful situation: the node leaving the Space abruptly is always the WP. 

In the right hand side we see how the solution presented does not present a substantial overhead comparing to NB.

# The Semantic Web and limited devices

???

Some <!-- Our early attempts with Arduino were unsuccessful-->

However, with current advances in:

 * semantic reasoners for this type of environments (mencionar al tio que hizo un razonador adaptado)
 * lightweight semantic formats
 * lightweight web protocols
 * mobile and embedded devices' the processing capacity
 * [autonomy of the batteries](http://energi.us/liberacion-patentes-tesla/) or
 * energy harvesting...

More and more devices will be able to manage semantics.
 <!--
 TODO
 Preparar una transpa de backup por si preguntan cómo de viable es.
 Ideas:
   * Many of the current devices are able to manage their info
   * Gráfico con pruebas que hicimos en su día:
    * Even if it is more verbosed
    * Some of them can reason and expand this information.
    * Others may need to rely in third machines.
     * Out of the scope
    * Anyway, we might be anticipating a trend.

# Hypothesis: some definitions

  * Heterogeneity: Fully-fledged computers and resource constrained devices (e.g., mobile and embedded devices) must coexist in these environments.
  * Autonomy: Devices must not depend on others to consume or provide data on their behalf.
  However, they might be aided by other devices to complete some related tasks (e.g., search the appropriate nodes to request).
  * Uncoupling: The communication must be data-driven.
  From the user perspective devices do not directly refer to each other.
  Additionally, the provider and the consumer should not coexist in time.
  However, note that since this sub-aspect contradicts the autonomy principle, their selection might be left to the user.
  * Interoperability: Devices must be able to exchange information with other systems and to use that information.

# Additional Evaluation

# Evaluation: Network activity (by role)

<img alt="Requests by role" src="img/transpas/evaluation_requests.png" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10%;" />

???

In the following chart we show the type of communication for an scenario with 100 consumers and different network sizes.

It shows that most of the requests are from consumers to providers.

Therefore, maintaining the architecture does not creates much overhead and it does not increase much with the number of consumers.
