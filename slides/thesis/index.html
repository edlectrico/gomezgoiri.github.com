In the beginning researchers created the Internet.

This is what __is know as__ the Internet of Things (IoT).

Both the IoT and the mobile computing have __contributed to Ubicomp__.

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).

It describes environments where devices imperceptibly work on our behalf.

<img alt="Devices work together" src="img/transpas/ubicomp02.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

But, in Mark's words, UbiComp's real power "comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the __interaction of all__ of them".

This interaction brings __challenges__ to UbiComp.

In this thesis I've  focused on two of them.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 1: dynamism

## Introduction

<img alt="Guy reading the news while his home works on his behalf" src="img/transpas/ubicomp01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

First, we have the dynamism.

This dynamism has its effects both in the short and the long term.

Since most devices have a mobile nature, they can come and go frequently in the short term.

<img alt="Space based computing: rd, in and out primitives" src="img/transpas/space-based.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

???

Space-based computing (or Tuple Spaces) faces this dynamism successfully.

Tuple Spaces is a paradigm where nodes coordinate with each other by writing and reading structured pieces of information (i.e., tuples) in a shared space.

This paradigm can be uncoupled in space and time.

__Space uncoupling__ is achieved because the nodes don't need to know each other beforehand to communicate.
That is, TS' primitives do not care about addresses and references, they just care about the content being shared.

__Time uncoupling__ is achieved because two nodes communicating with each other do not need to coexist at the same time.

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="Dude, what are you talking about?" src="img/transpas/interoperability01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

The second challenge UbiComp has to face is that both the devices and the applications build upon them are heterogeneous.

This means that the interoperability is a key property for these environments.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

The [IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2238) defines __interoperability__ as

 > The ability of two or more systems or components to __exchange__ information
 > and to __use__ the information that has been exchanged.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity

The [IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2238) defines __interoperability__ as

> .weak[The ability of two or more systems or components to _exchange_ information
> and to __use__ the information that has been exchanged.]

???

So, let's first talk about the second problem: how to use (or reuse) information.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2a: use info
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="The robot does not understand chinese or japanese" src="img/transpas/interoperability02.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

We can identify two levels to allow this __use__:

 1. The  __syntactic__ level cares about  the format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
    * For instance, if the robot does not undestand chinese characters, the information the mobile phone provides will be useless.

 1. The __semantic__ level gives a precise meaning to the info
    * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->
    * Following the example, this character may mean different things depending on the context (and it does actually).
    * TODO Preguntar a primez cual era el caracter conflictivo!
     * Funnily enough, I translated something to chinese for this presentation using an automatic tool.
     * When my co-supervisor asked about the meaning to a chinese colleague, it was confused because the meaning was either "X or X".

.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="The robot does understand terms" src="img/transpas/interoperability03.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

To achieve both levels, I propose to use __Semantic Web__ standards and tools.

 > .weak[The __vision__ of the Semantic Web is to extend principles of the Web from documents to data.
 > Data should be accessed using the general Web architecture using, e.g., URI-s;
 > data should be __related to one another__ just as documents (or portions of documents) are already.
 > This also means creation of a common framework that allows data

???

The other aspect which affect the interoperability is __how to exchange information__.

To interoperate, it is better to adopt a __widely accepted__ communication mechanism. <!-- mechanism/protocols -->
This is called interop __ab-initio__.

And what's more accepted today than...

The web is massively accepted <!--by humans. (this is not a real reason) -->

 * But also, by machines: a lot of applications expose their capabilities using HTTP APIs

It achieves the following properties  (see Fielding's thesis)

* Scalability

Note that most of these properties are particularly useful for limited devices.

<img alt="The web of Things" src="img/transpas/wot.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

As a consequence, the web has been widely applied to IoT, bringing what people has called the __Web of Things__ (WoT).

<!-- Transpa backup: WoT challenges: push approach, subscription mechanisms... -->

In the WoT, everyday things expose their capabilities through web standards.
This way, they are first-class web citizens and can seamlessly work with other web apps.

This goes hand in hand with my interest in having devices which are not mere clients, but also active data providers.

<!-- TODO Delimit the scope in this section or in the next one? -->

<img alt="Scope of the dissertation" src="img/transpas/venn_background.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

<!-- Aprovecho esta ptranspa para hacer una pasada superficial al estado del arte -->

After analyzing these research areas in the UbiComp domain I saw that...

Space-based computing

 * has often been applied to UbiComp
 * and it has also been used with Semantics (I focus on Triple Space Computing paradigm or TSC), <!-- Necesario porque luego lo nombro en la hipotesis -->
 * but usually centrallizing the space on powerful devices.

This is also common in most of the systems which use the Semantic Web in UbiComp.

---

# Possible solution: Intermediary providers

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_centralize.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

<!--
1. cacharros enviando sus ficheros rdf a un servidor
2. cacharro preguntando a un servidor
-->

???

So, one popular design solution when working with limited devices is to centralize all the knowledge in a more powerful machine (or machines).
For sake of clarity, let's assume that there is just one machine.

This way, the devices periodically send their information to this machine,
and it stores all the information.

Whenever a limited device needs to query for something, it has to ask to this machine.

The reasons to do this are mainly two:

 1. semantic processing can add too much overhead to limited devices
 2. it is hard to ensure the information availability with unsteady (too dynamic) devices

However,

 1. current embedded and mobile devices are notably more powerful than 5 years ago
 <!--
 TODO
 Preparar una transpa de backup por si preguntan cómo de viable es.
 Ideas:
   * Many of the current devices are able to manage their info
   * Gráfico con pruebas que hicimos en su día:
    * Even if it is more verbosed
    * Some of them can reason and expand this information.
    * Others may need to rely in third machines.
     * Out of the scope
    * Anyway, we might be anticipating a trend.
 -->
 2. Availability is not always a requirement. In fact, the unavailability, "represents" the mobile nature of the environment/space.


So, with these considerations in mind, I made myself a question:
<!-- research question => PhD opportunity -->

 * Can these devices get __more involved__ in the management of the space?
   Not only as mere clients.

---

# Problems with intermediary providers


<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_centralize_problems.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

<!--
[Situación 1: sensor con fichero de t5, servidor t3]
[Situación 2: sensor intenta preguntar a un servidor que ya no existe]
-->

???

Problems:

 *  When devices rely on others to provide information, it is not guaranteed
 that the information accessed will accurately represent the last information
 available in the data providers (e.g., the sensors).

 * Once they rely on intermediaries, these intermediaries must be available at
 all time. Otherwise, the devices would not be able to talk to each other.
  * Having dedicated servers is costly and hard to manage in simple scenarios
  * Externalizing these servers, makes you system dependant on third-parties.

And this happens way too frequently on the Internet.
For example, the Navastag was an IoT which completely depent on an external service.
The company of this internet-connected bunny dissapeared and they did not maintain the servers.
<!-- They released a poorly documented code. -->
As a consequence, nowadays the Navastag is pretty much an expensive decoration.

# Goals

 1. Space model
 2. Search architecture
 3. Actuation mechanism

[ ICONS? ]

???

1. Propose a new space model which merges the benefits from Space-based computing and the web.
1. An energy-aware search for this new model.
1. An actuation mechanism.

In my dissertation, and in this presentation, I've focused on the second aspect.

Consequently, I will restrict myself to a brief comment on the first and third points.

---

# Space model

<img alt="Proposed dual model" src="img/new_model.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

Analysis:

 * Networking properties
 * Coordination properties
 * Is it for limited devices?

???

After several attempts, I came up with the __dual model__ shown in the figure.

It is composed by:

 * Coordination space
  * Pretty much a classical semantic space
  * It is enhanced by the information provided by autonomous devices (or asteroids) which are part of the
 * Outer space
  * __Enriched view__
  * what's happening on __real time__

This model confines much of the information in the devices.

I analysed this model from different perspectives.

---

# Space model: networking properties

<img alt="TSC is resource oriented and matches with HTTP verbs" src="img/transpas/networking_properties01.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

To analyse the networking properties of the solution proposed, we must note that both spaces are accessed through their APIs.

Both APIs are based on the space-based computing primitives, which are compatible with (most of) the REST principles:

* It is resource oriented: the resources are the spaces, RDF Graphs and RDF triples.
* HTTP verbs can be directly mapped to TSC primitives.
* We use other HTTP features: status codes, content negotiation, etc.

---

# Space model: networking properties

<img alt="The API is not hypermedia-driven" src="img/transpas/networking_properties02.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

Unfortunately, the APIs are not hypermedia-driven, that is they do not follow the HATEOAS REST principle.

In short, this principle means that the client should not __know__ anything apart from an __URL__ to use an API.
It should drive the interaction __selecting the new application states__ from the web hypermedia content provided by the server at each step.

Although, the API is actually hypermedia-driven for humans, it is not for machines.
This has left as future work.

<hr>

Anyway, accessing to the spaces through a REST-like API provides the following features to our model:

* Scalability (4+)
* Simplicity (3+-)
* UP performance, efficiency & evolvability (2+)
* Portability, extensibility, configurability, reusability & reliability (+)
* Visibility (+-)
* Net performance (-)

And it also comes with some drawbacks:

* Less simplicity, reusability & visibility than pure REST APIs (hypermedia-driven)
* Mechanisms such as subscriptions and transactions go against the statelessness

Specifically, we will see how this affects coordination properties.

# Space model: coordination properties

What about the uncoupling?

Obviously, the coordination space corresponds with the clasical model and therefore has both uncoupling levels.

  </span>
</div>

???

In the _outer space_, programmers are forced by space-based primitives not to care about data too.

However, regarding _time uncoupling_, since each provider holds its content, this is only accessible when the provider is available.

Some possible solutions to avoid this uncoupling would be: to move contents to other nodes or to replicate contents.
However, this will come at the cost of more complexity and networking activity.
<!-- * __Move contents__ to other nodes
  * how to distinguish the reliable ones?
  * the measures would be moved away from where they are generated
   * what if the other node lefts the space but the provider is available?
* __Replicate__ contents
  * more networking
  * maintaining the data consistency is not easy with unreliable nodes
-->

Therefore, I kept it this way, with an time coupled outer-space, when I identified (realized) that we used the space for different purposes:

 1. Search for information
 1. Coordinate through the space

Time uncoupling is particularly important for coordination, but not so much to search (in real time).

# Space model: properties for UbiComp

<img alt="Space and time" src="img/transpas/ubicomp_properties01.png" class="center" style="width:90%;"/>

???

Finally, we can see how the properties commented before interrelate with desirable properties in UbiComp.

Particularly, we can see two conflictive interrelations:

---

# Space model: properties for UbiComp

<img alt="Space and time" src="img/transpas/ubicomp_properties02.png" class="center" style="width:90%;"/>

 1. The web has a low networking perfomance

---

# Space model: properties for UbiComp

<img alt="Space and time" src="img/transpas/ubicomp_properties03.png" class="center" style="width:90%;"/>

???

 2. The semantic web negatively affects computation overload and energy autonomy

To reduce the first one, we can redesign the API or just adopt more lightweight protocols (e.g., CoAP which mimics many of HTTP's properties).

For the latter one, we have specifically designed a search architecture.

---

# Energy-aware Search Architecture

???

And this is precisely the second goal of my dissertation.

---

# Motivation: in the context of this PhD <!-- Or specific -->

How to search in the _outer space_?

<img alt="Proposed dual model" src="img/new_model.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

???

How can we search in the _outer space_?

Remember that the "asteroids" from the right-hand side are independent small web providers.

Or generalizing it...

---

# Motivation: a generalization

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_motivation.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

How to search in a semantic web provided by limited devices?
(and remember my driving motivation: to promote the direct communication between)

--

# My solution: Promote the direct communication

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_everyone.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>
<!-- cacharros preguntandose entre sí -->

???

To avoid this kind of situations, I conceived an environments where devices communicate with each other directly.

But, obviously, we cannot do this at any price.

For instance, a broadcasting-based solution will generate innecessary computation and networking activity.

---

# Evaluation: Energy consumption

<img alt="Energy consumption for each type of activity" src="img/energy_consumption.svg" style="width: 90%;" />

???

And since computation and networking result in significant higher energy consumption,
we need to find a strategy which efficiently manages both aspects.

Particularly, I propose to:

* Move the load __from less powerful to more powerful__ devices

To this end, I propose to use dynamic intermediaries (i.e., "search facilitators")

 1. They __improve__ the search, become it smarter
 1. Help to move the __management tasks__ created by my proposal __to__ more __powerful__ devices

---

class: center, middle
<!--# Elements in the architecture proposed-->

<img alt="Energy-aware search architecture" src="img/transpas/architecture.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

???

We can see the following __roles__:

1. Providers: carry their own information (mobile scenarios)
1. Consumers: directly request/query providers to obtain fresh data
1. White Page to enhance the search
 * WP is chosen __dynamically__: considering energy consumption and computation
  * changes over the time
 * Consumers __don't depend__ on the WP to resolve the queries
  * Just to get and update the clues

Additionally, we can see how semantic data is summarized in information pieces called __clues__ (or indexes).
There are two types:
 * Clues gererated by providers
 * Aggregated clues which are the sum of individual clues, managed in the WP

---

# Clues

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/clues_working.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

<!-- schema prov sending a clue and getting an aggregated clue version -->

???

Note that the system is based in an assumption:
__clues do not change frequently since they represent the type of information the nodes host rather than the specific data which is constantly generated__

* Clues generated by a provider and sent to the WP getting an aggregated clue version
 1. every time a clue is updated
 2. before its lifetime expires
 3. whenever there is a new WP in the Space with a lower setup version than the one in the Provider

* Aggregated clues
 * obtained by Consumers
  1. when they don't have one
  2. periodically
   * upper time: ensures a fresh view
   * lower time: not to flood the WP
   * in between, with the last 10 queries
 * they process them to decide which nodes to ask for information
 * as an optimization WP can answer this elements

---

# Clue content

<img alt="Semantic example and clue types" src="img/transpas/semantic_example.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

???

The semantic web is formed by RDF triples.
They are composed by a subject, a predicate and an object.

Clues need to:

* summarize the information hold by a provider
* not change frequently

I considered three alternatives:

* Classes stored
* Prefixes
* Predicates

---

# WP

selection

???

The selection process can start

1. when no WP is available (the first node to realize the absence starts it) or
2. when the current WP gets a worse score than other nodes (the current WP)


How? Ranking them according to information provided by discovery mechanism.

* memory of the device
* storage capacity of the device
* time since it joined the Space (aproximately)
* its battery charge

---

# Experimental environment

<img alt="Real time measures" src="img/transpas/time_measures.png" style="width: 100%;" />

<img alt="Sample templates" src="img/transpas/evaluation_templates.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

To test all this architecture, I carried out several simulations.

To parametrize them, I used the following response times tested in several devices as inputs.

These time measures affect the performance of the solution (e.g., indirectly how much energy consumed).

For the data provided in the simulation, I used real knowledge from real datasets describing sensing stations and their measures.

The templates used are the ones shown, which try to consider queries from different nature.

---

# Evaluation: Network activity

<img alt="Requests generated using different strategies" src="img/requests_by_strategies.svg" style="width: 90%;" />

???

Obviously it is better than flooding

And comparing to caching, it depends on the # of providers and the # of queries.

However, the more of each elements the scenario has, the better our solution is compared to caching.

---

# Evaluation: Network activity (by device type)

<img alt="Energy consumption for each class" src="img/activity_measures.svg" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10%;" />

???

On the right hand side we can see how on average, __activity is reduced__ considerably.

On the left hand side, we see that

 * limited devices face less requests
 * the additional tasks generated by the solution are moved to the more powerful ones

# Evaluation: Network activity (high dynamism)

This chart show how the solution proposes does not generate too much overhead even when the WP drops out frequently.

We also tested it with mDNS discovery.

# Contributions

* Space-model
* Energy aware search
 * Promotes end-to-end HTTP requests between constrained devices
 * Balances the management load considering devices' computing and energy capacities
 * Structures the nodes in different dynamic roles with different responsibilities
* Analysis of how to interoperate with existing REST-based actuators from space-based computing
 
 <!-- Enumerar la larga que la tengo? -->

???

* End-to-end: they do not need an intermediary to search (i.e., to select the appropriate providers to request).

# Technical contributions

* __Otsopack__
* Parametrizable __simulation environment__
* Implementation of the same __basic actuation scenario__ to compare different actuation mechanisms
 
In parallel...

* Lightweight __user access control__ for limited devices
* Use of Otsopack in a number of __different domains__
 * Homes, hospitals and residences, supermarkets or hotels.

???

Otsopack is a middleware which follows some of the ideas presented about web-based semantic space-based computing.

To finish, let me thank all the people who has helped me during this time citing one of the greatest philosopher ever.

# Space model: baseline

Triple Space Computing (TSC)

 * Spaces identified by URIs
 * Tuples == RDF Triples & RDF Graphs
 * Templates = triple patterns

<div style="margin-top:2em;" />

![Resources in TSC](img/tsc_resources.svg)

Uses elements from the SW

# Space model: completely decentralized

 * Each device manages its own information
 * It asks to the rest using a __P2P__ approach

[table with benefits and drawbacks]

???

I did this prior to knowing that I wanted to be a PhD student.

Alternative model.

Benefits:

* Reduces __dependency__ on others
  * each device manages its own knowledge
  * this simplifies the __management__
* Reduces networking in __writings__
  * Which are quite frequent (updates of a sensor measure)

Drawbacks:

* Flooding-based __search__: networking
* __Inconsistency__ (Brewer)
* __JXTA__: not really interoperable

  * Not appropriate for limited devices
  * Discontinued
  * A nightmare!

Problem: semantic computation (podemos poner hasta graficos de cosas que hayamos hecho)

# Hypothesis: some definitions

  * Heterogeneity: Fully-fledged computers and resource constrained devices (e.g., mobile and embedded devices) must coexist in these environments.
  * Autonomy: Devices must not depend on others to consume or provide data on their behalf.
  However, they might be aided by other devices to complete some related tasks (e.g., search the appropriate nodes to request).
  * Uncoupling: The communication must be data-driven.
  From the user perspective devices do not directly refer to each other.
  Additionally, the provider and the consumer should not coexist in time.
  However, note that since this sub-aspect contradicts the autonomy principle, their selection might be left to the user.
  * Interoperability: Devices must be able to exchange information with other systems and to use that information.

# Evaluation: Network activity (by role)

<img alt="Requests by role" src="img/transpas/evaluation_requests.png" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10%;" />

???

In the following chart we show the type of communication for an scenario with 100 consumers and different network sizes.

It shows that most of the requests are from consumers to providers.

Therefore, maintaining the architecture does not creates much overhead and it does not increase much with the number of consumers.
